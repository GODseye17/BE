Patients were \nincluded if they were managed at a healthcare facility and excluded if they \ncoingested a medication that may cause significant hypoglycemia, the exposure \nwas for suicidal intent, or the exposure was not followed to a known clinical \noutcome.\nRESULTS: ToxSentryWeb identified 186 potential cases; 152 met the study criteria \n(130 symptomatic and 22 asymptomatic patients). Nausea (92%) and vomiting (76%) \nwere the most reported clinical effects in the symptomatic group. Hypoglycemia \noccurred in 9% of patients. Most of the clinical effects lasted 8 to 24 hours. \nThese effects were managed primarily with intravenous fluids (56%) and/or \nantiemetics (51%). Notably, a higher proportion of patients in the asymptomatic \ngroup were exposed to dulaglutide, and a higher proportion of patients in the \nsymptomatic group were exposed to semaglutide.\nCONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This study reveals a critical gap in understanding the \nclinical outcomes of GLP-1 and GLP-1/GIP RA exposures. Most patients experience \nmild gastrointestinal symptoms, which typically resolve within 8 to 24 hours \nwith short-term observation. However, hypoglycemia was observed at a higher rate \nthan previously reported despite the absence of concomitant hypoglycemic agents, \nunderscoring the need for close monitoring. These findings suggest that \nproviders should tailor observation times based on symptom severity, while \nemphasizing patient education on proper administration to prevent misuse and \nensure optimal therapeutic outcomes.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/10600280251334642\nPMID: 40269635",

Its widespread media coverage may have an outsized impact on \nadolescents and young adults due to their higher engagement in social media and \ntheir vulnerability to unintended consequences of weight-related discourse \n(e.g., body dissatisfaction, disordered eating, weight stigma). This study aimed \nto determine youth familiarity with and opinions about use of medications such \nas Ozempic and Wegovy for weight loss.\nMETHODS: Five open-ended questions were asked to 753 youth participants \n(14-24\u00a0years) in the MyVoice nationwide text message poll in March 2024. \nResponses were analyzed using content analysis and coding differences resolved \nby consensus. Differences by demographic characteristics were explored using \nchi-square tests.\nRESULTS: Overall, 547 (73%) youth responded; average age was 20.4 \u00b1 2.5\u00a0years, \nwith 50.3% identifying as female. Nearly three-quarters (73.6%) had heard of \nmedications like Ozempic and Wegovy, but the majority (57.5%) stated that these \nmedications should not be used by youth. Three primary concerns arose: (1) \nsafety; (2) inappropriate use; and (3) role of personal responsibility for \nhealthy lifestyle (a belief that was more common among males than females or \nother gender).\nDISCUSSION: Awareness about semaglutide was high, but perceptions of use were \ngenerally negative or hesitant, particularly among males, who emphasized the \nimportance of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Hesitancy due to safety concerns and \nthe role of weight stigma should be explored to determine the potential impact \non users of such medications when medically indicated.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

The aim was to compare the effect of different drug-dose combinations \nof GLP-1RAs on SBP. The secondary aim was to assess whether changes in SBP with \nGLP-1RAs are associated with weight change. MEDLINE and Cochrane were searched \nuntil January 2022 for randomized control trials (RCTs) on patients with \nobesity, evaluating the impact of semaglutide, liraglutide, efpeglenatide, or \nexenatide on SBP. Separate analyses were done for trials with and without \ndiabetes. Multivariate meta-regression assessed if SBP changes with GLP-1RA \nvaried based on weight change or follow-up duration. Thirty-five RCTs were \nincluded. Follow-up duration ranged from 12 to 68\u2009weeks for T2DM and 12-56\u2009weeks \nfor non-T2DM patients. GLP-1RAs significantly lowered SBP for all patients (MD = \n-3.14 [-3.60; -2.68]). Subgroup analysis showed a significantly greater \ndifference in SBP reduction for patients without diabetes (-3.80 [-4.24; -3.37]) \nwhen compared with patients with diabetes (-2.13 [-3.27; -1.00]). Among patients \nwith diabetes, liraglutide <\u20092 mg OD showed the greatest reduction in SBP (-3.78 \n[-6.27; -1.28]), while efpeglenatide \u2264\u20096 mg QW showed the greatest reduction in \nSBP (-6.00 [-9.89; -2.11]) in patients without diabetes. GLP-1RAs result in mild \nreductions in SBP in patients with obesity. The change in SBP varies only \nslightly by the drug-dose combination and appears to be related to the amount of \nweight loss.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Factors \nthat may influence drug spending in hospitals and clinics in 2025 were \nreviewed-including new drug approvals, patent expirations, and potential new \npolicies or legislation. Focused analyses were conducted for biosimilars, cancer \ndrugs, endocrine drugs, generics, specialty drugs and vaccines. For nonfederal \nhospitals, clinics, and overall (all sectors), estimates of growth of \npharmaceutical expenditures in 2024 were made based on a combination of \nquantitative analyses and expert opinion.\nRESULTS: In 2024, overall pharmaceutical expenditures in the US grew 10.2% \ncompared to 2023, for a total of $805.9 billion. Utilization (a 7.9% increase) \nand new drugs (a 2.5% increase) drove this increase, while prices remained flat \n(a 0.2% decrease). Semaglutide was the top drug in 2024, followed by tirzepatide \nand adalimumab. Drug expenditures were $39.0 billion (a 4.9% increase) and \n$158.2 billion (a 14.4% increase) in nonfederal hospitals and clinics, \nrespectively. In clinics, increased utilization drove growth, with a small \ncontribution from new products, while prices remained flat. In nonfederal \nhospitals, new products, price, and new volume each contributed modestly to \ngrowth in spend. Several new drugs that will influence spending are expected to \nbe approved in 2025. Specialty, endocrine, and cancer drugs will continue to \ndrive expenditures.\nCONCLUSION: For 2025, we expect overall prescription drug spending to rise by \n9.0 to 11.0%, whereas in clinics and hospitals we anticipate an 11.0% to 13.0% \nincrease and a 2.0% to 4.0% increase, respectively, compared to 2024. These \nnational estimates of future pharmaceutical expenditure growth may not be \nrepresentative of any health system because of the myriad of local factors that \ninfluence actual spending.\n\n\u00a9 American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2025.

While current research on GLP-1 \nagonists, including semaglutide, focuses primarily on their therapeutic effects \nin managing diabetes and obesity, information regarding their forensic and \nmedicolegal significance is limited. Concerns related to GLP-1 agonists may \narise due to their pharmacokinetics, potential drug-drug interactions, and side \neffects including hypoglycemia, which can be relevant in cases involving human \nperformance, such as impaired driving, or in unexpected fatalities. Semaglutide \nadditionally presents analytical challenges due to its large, highly charged \nmolecular structure and potentially limited stability in whole blood, which may \ncomplicate its detection and quantification in forensic laboratories using \ncommon instrumentation. The development of robust analytical methods will be \nessential to account for its pharmacological effects and to address its \npotential role in intoxications or unexplained fatalities, especially in the \ncontext of misuse or off-label use for weight loss. A strong case can be made \nfor the necessity of further research into the detection, quantification, and \ninterpretation of semaglutide concentrations in forensic toxicology casework.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

An increase in \nskeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) efficiency upon diet-mediated \nweight loss has been described, which may contribute to reduced systemic energy \nexpenditure and weight regain. We set out to determine the unknown effect of \nsemaglutide on muscle OXPHOS efficiency.\nMETHODS: C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12\u2009weeks before receiving \nsemaglutide or vehicle for 1 or 3\u2009weeks. The rates of ATP production and oxygen \n(O2) consumption were measured via high-resolution respirometry and fluorometry \nto determine OXPHOS efficiency in muscle at these two time points.\nRESULTS: Semaglutide treatment led to significant reductions in fat and lean \nmass. Semaglutide improved skeletal muscle OXPHOS efficiency, measured as ATP \nproduced per O2 consumed in permeabilized muscle fibers. Mitochondrial proteomic \nanalysis revealed changes restricted to two proteins linked to complex III \nassembly (LYRM7 and TTC19; p\u2009<\u20090.05 without multiple corrections) without \nsubstantial changes in the abundance of OXPHOS subunits.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that weight loss with semaglutide treatment \nincreases skeletal muscle mitochondrial efficiency.

We conducted a \ncomprehensive synthesis of known effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs on the \ncognitive, cellular, and molecular changes in neurodegenerative diseases.\nMETHODS: We examined preclinical and clinical paradigms that investigated \nchanges in neurodegenerative disease pathology following administration of GLP-1 \nand GLP-1 RAs. Relevant articles were retrieved through OVID (MedLine, Embase, \nAMED, PsychINFO, JBI EBP Database), PubMed, and Web of Science from database \ninception to September 27th, 2024. Primary studies investigating the \naforementioned changes following GLP-1 and GLP-1 RA administration were \nretrieved for analysis (n\u202f=\u202f62).\nRESULTS: GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs (i.e. dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, \nlixisenatide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide) improved cognitive and motor \nfunction in neurodegenerative diseases in preclinical and clinical paradigms. \nAdditionally, GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs were associated with modulating changes in \nneuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and proliferative pathways.\nDISCUSSION: We observed that GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs modulate molecular and cellular \nchanges known to govern the phenomenology of neurodegenerative diseases. Future \nresearch should examine the interaction between signaling molecules, neuronal \nsubpopulations, and cognitive effects affected by GLP-1 and GLP-1 RA \nadministration.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Authors.
