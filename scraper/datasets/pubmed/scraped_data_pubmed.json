Delayed diagnosis and treatment \nhamper the testicular salvage rate and the subsequent recovery of the fertility. \nAlthough detorsion surgery restores the testicular blood flow, the process of \ntorsion/detorsion leads to ischemia/reperfusion injury, which aggravates the \nprimary damage due to the excessive generation of free radicals that disrupt \nantioxidant homeostasis. In the present study, we investigated the role of \nendoplasmic reticulum protein, thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5, in \nischemia/reperfusion-induced testicular fibrosis. We showed that apart from \ndisrupted testicular structure, elevated transforming growth factor beta 1, \nalpha-smooth muscle actin, and collagen type 1 protein expression accompanied by \nTXNDC5 upregulation were detected in mice that underwent ischemia/reperfusion \ninjury. By Txndc5 deletion, fibrosis, redox oxidation, and extracellular \nmatrix-associated signaling pathways and their accompanied genes/proteins were \ndownregulated, indicating amelioration of testicular tissue damage and fibrosis \nin Txndc5-/- mice. With the apparent restoration of testicular structure and \nspermatogenesis, our study provides a potential therapeutic strategy by \ntargeting TXNDC5 in testicular torsion patients to reduce \nischemia/reperfusion-induced testicular fibrosis and to restore their fertility.\n\nDOI: 10.1530/REP-25-0022\nPMID: 40261983",

This study was therefore designed to investigate the \neffect of blockage of ROS in the ischemic and reperfusion phases of TIRI. Thirty \nmale Wistar rats were grouped into five groups (n\u2009=\u20096 rats each): sham, \ntorsion\u2009+\u2009detorsion (TD), febuxostat (FEB)-administered (TFD) group, vitamin E \n(V)-administered (TDV) group, and FEB and vitamin E-administered (TFDV) group. \nBlood samples (for inflammatory and hormonal assay), testicular (for oxidative \nstress and histopathology), and epididymal (for sperm DNA damage and indices) \ntissues were collected after 3\u00a0days of detorsion. The TFD and TFDV groups showed \na significant reduction in XO and MDA (p\u2009<\u20090.001; \u03b72\u2009>\u20090.7), as well as a \nconcomitant increase in CAT, thiols, and SOD levels when compared with the TD \ngroup (p\u2009<\u20090.01, \u03b72\u2009>\u20090.5). The TFD group significantly reduced all inflammatory \nmarkers (p\u2009<\u20090.05; \u03b72\u2009=\u20090.75). The observed increase (p\u2009<\u20090.05; \u03b72\u2009=\u20090.92) in LH \nlevel, in response to a low level of testosterone in the TD group, was \nsignificantly raised in TFD and TFDV groups. The observed decrease (p\u2009<\u20090.001) \nin inhibin level in the TD group was raised (p\u2009<\u20090.05; \u03b72\u2009=\u20090.90) in the TDV \ngroup only. A significant increase (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in sperm DNA damage in the TD \ngroup was significantly reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.05; \u03b72\u2009=\u20090.88) in all the treatment \ngroups while the reduced sperm viability (p\u2009<\u20090.01) in the TD group was \nincreased (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in the TFDV group only. There was an improvement in the \ntesticular cytoarchitecture in the TFD and TFDV groups. This study showed that \nsequential administration of febuxostat in the ischemic phase of TT and vitamin \nE in the later phase of reperfusion protects the testes against TIRI via \ninhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, and sperm DNA damage.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Multiparametric ultrasound has proven to be a fundamental \nand valuable imaging modality in this context, improving early-phase sensitivity \nthrough various techniques, including B-Mode, color Doppler, power Doppler, \npulsed Doppler, microflow studies, and elastography. In this context, \nContrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) emerges as a rapid, safe, and valuable tool \nin enhancing diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic decisions for acute scrotal \nconditions. This study involves a detailed analysis of various ultrasound \nimaging techniques and investigates the optimal circumstances and methods for \nemploying CEUS in emergency situations to improve diagnostic accuracy and \ntherapeutic decisions. Multiparametric ultrasound plays a crucial role in \ndiagnosing various pathologies, including testicular torsion, appendage torsion, \ninflammation, ischemia/infarction, and trauma. CEUS provides real-time \nassessment of vascular perfusion, aiding in early diagnosis and accurate \ncharacterization of scrotal pathologies and significantly reducing the need for \nunnecessary surgical interventions, especially in trauma cases. Its role in \ndifferentiating between various pathologies and guiding therapeutic decisions \nunderscores its importance in clinical practice, contributing significantly to \nimprove patient outcomes.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Registration of parameters included \nsymptoms, durations, ultrasound conclusions, and surgical outcome. Ultrasound \nassessment included inspection of the spermatic cord and testicular color \nDoppler signal. Sensitivity and specificity were presented with 95% confidence \nintervals (CIs) and symptoms with odds ratios (ORs).ResultsA total of 387 \npatients were included. Surgical exploration (SE) was carried out in 40 \npatients. TT was surgically confirmed in 23 patients. No missed cases of TT were \ndetected. Spermatic cord rotation \u2265180\u00b0 showed a sensitivity of 100% (95% \nCI=86-100), specificity of 65% (95% CI=41-83), positive predictive value (PPV) \nof 79%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. Absent or reduced \ntesticular color Doppler signal showed a sensitivity of 57% (95% CI=37-74), \nspecificity of 77% (95% CI=53-90), PPV of 76%, and NPV of 57%. Sudden onset of \npain (OR=9.44, 95% CI=2.10-42.35), earlier similar episodes (OR=6.71, 95% \nCI=2.27-19.89), and abdominal pain (OR=14.70, 95% CI=3.25-66.51) showed \nsignificant association with TT.ConclusionUltrasound, with focus on the \nspermatic cord, is reliable as a tool for the detection of TT. SE might be \njustified when cord rotation is \u2265180\u00b0. These results can be used to develop and \nvalidate ultrasound guidelines for fast detection.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/02841851251331560\nPMID: 40232242",

Our secondary objective was to create and compare a new TT score \n[Testicular Emergency Score for Torsion (TEST) score].\nMETHODS: This was a multicenter prospective study in 21 Spanish pediatric \nemergency departments between 2020 and 2022, including 903 children 3 months to \n18 years old with non-traumatic unilateral testicular pain, of them 93 TT \n(10.3%). To create a new score, the sample was randomly divided into derivation \nand validation set.\nRESULTS: The performance of the TWIST, TT score, AIS, and BALS was good, and the \nproportion of patients correctly classified as low risk was 37.9%, 52.7%, 30.3%, \nand 28%, respectively. The TEST score included the following predictors of TT \nidentified by multivariable logistic regression analysis: age, duration of pain, \nnausea/vomiting, testicular volume increase, testicular elevation, induration, \nand absence of cremasteric reflex. TEST score had a higher area under the \nreceiver operating curve (area under the curve) and correctly classified in the \nlow-risk group of 63.6% of the patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although TWIST, TT score, BALS, and AIS scores showed a good \nperformance, the TEST score identifies a larger group of low-risk patients \nsuitable for safe management without Doppler ultrasound.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This review \naddresses the diagnostic challenges, imaging patterns, and management strategies \nfor both ovarian and testicular torsion, including a brief discussion on the \nemerging role of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS), therefore filling a \nsignificant gap in the literature. We emphasize the need for a high index of \nsuspicion due to often nonspecific clinical presentations, particularly in \novarian torsion. An accurate and swift diagnosis allows conservative surgical \nintervention to be offered, which is crucial to maximize gonadal salvage and \nminimize recurrence. While we highlight CEUS's potential benefits in enhancing \ndiagnostic clarity without ionizing radiation, ultrasound and other modalities \nsuch as MRI and CT, have a paramount role in this setting. Future research \ncomparing CEUS with MRI is essential to validate its diagnostic accuracy and \neffectiveness, potentially revolutionizing acute care diagnostics. Incorporating \nCEUS into diagnostic workflows, along with a deep understanding of the \ncondition's epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation, may \nprobably significantly improve patient outcomes. We detail the characteristic \nimaging features, diagnostic pitfalls, and differential diagnoses essential for \nradiologists, with particular relevance for residents and those with limited \npediatric radiology exposure.

A short systematic review was conducted to evaluate the question: in \npatients presenting with acute unilateral testicular pain, is a negative Prehn's \nsign an accurate sign for diagnosis of testicular torsion (TT)?Medline, Embase \nand Cochrane databases were searched using the OVID interface from inception to \n26 February 2025. Following the removal of duplicates, the search strategy \nyielded a total of 11 papers. Study information, participant group, relevant \noutcomes and study weaknesses were extracted from each article.Four studies \naddressed the three-part question. The only study that had the full text \navailable for review found that 33% of patients with TT had a positive Prehn's \nsign, which equated to an OR of 5.941 (95% CI 1.432 to 24.658). Of the three \nremaining retrospective cohort studies, Prehn's sign was reported to be positive \nin 10.5%, 37.5% and 100% of patients with TT, respectively. Therefore, the \nnegativity of Prehn's sign ranged from 0% to 89.5% in patients with TT.The \nclinical bottom line is that Prehn's sign is insufficiently sensitive to rule \nout TT; however, its negativity increases the likelihood of a TT diagnosis.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.
