We identified the \nrange and characteristics of DAs, focusing on their development stage according \nto guideline recommendations, their outcomes, and effectiveness.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, \nCINAHL, and PsycINFO, along with manual searches. Eligible articles reported DAs \nfor supporting families affected by hereditary cancer syndromes, published in \nEnglish from inception to July 2024. Quality was assessed using the Mixed \nMethods Appraisal Tool.\nRESULTS: From 15,066 records, 32 studies with a moderate risk of bias, reporting \n23 unique DAs, were identified. Most DAs targeted women (69.6%) with hereditary \nbreast and ovarian cancer syndrome (73.9%) in North America and Europe (81.3%), \nprimarily supporting decisions on cancer risk-reduction strategies (56.5%) and \ngenetic testing/counseling (47.8%). Only four DAs were consistent with \nguideline-recommended development process, including prototype development, \nalpha- and beta-testing. Development and alpha-testing outcomes included user \nexperience, understandability, and psychological impact. Beta-testing evaluated \ndecision-making capacity, quality of the decision-making process, psychological \nimpact, and impact on decisions. DAs consistently improved decision-making \ncapacity and quality of the decision-making process but showed variable effects \non psychological outcomes and actual decision in risk-management.\nCONCLUSION: DAs are under-developed for genetic, racial, or gender minorities, \naccording to guideline-recommended development process. Future research should \ndevelop DAs for broader populations and clarify their effectiveness, \nparticularly regarding psychological outcomes.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

The TLR/MYD88 pathway plays \na critical role in dendritic cells (DC) maturation and function, contributing to \nthe body's innate immunity. Recent studies have further highlighted MYD88's \npivotal role in intrinsic immunity and its regulatory influence on the tumor \nmicroenvironment (TME) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of \nMYD88 in DCs and its regulatory role in the TME have gained increasing \nattention.\nMETHODS: RNA-sequencing data retrieved from the TCGA and GEO databases were \nutilized for both the training and validation of our signature. Single-cell RNA \ntranscriptome data from GEO were analyzed to investigate the correlation among \nsubclusters of T cells, myeloid cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) within the HCC \ntumor microenvironment (TME). A combination of bioinformatics and machine \nlearning approaches was employed to perform statistical analyses.Additionally, \nflow cytometry was conducted to quantify T cell subtypes and assess biomarker \nexpression in DCs. A BALB/c-derived xenograft mouse model was established to \nevaluate the functional role of MyD88 in tumor progression and immunotherapy \nresponse. Furthermore, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed to \nreassess the biological effects of MyD88 in HCC patients undergoing immune \ncheckpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy.\nRESULTS: Our pan-cancer data analysis further highlights the significant impact \nof MYD88 on clinical outcomes in HCC. Analysis of TCGA and GEO databases \nconfirms that MYD88 serves as a key signaling molecule in DCs, reinforcing its \ncritical role in immune regulation. Our in vitro experiments demonstrates that \nMyD88 modulates T cell function through DCs. In vivo, H22 tumor cells exhibited \naccelerated growth in MyD88 knockout mice and a reduced response to anti-PD-1 \ntreatment, whereas wild-type mice showed the opposite trend.\nDISCUSSION: These findings underscore the critical role of MYD88 in DC function, \nsuggesting its potential as a biomarker for immunoregulation in HCC. By shaping \nthe TME, MYD88 not only regulates the immune response in HCC but also influences \npatient clinical outcomes. Both ex vivo and in vivo experiments further validate \nthat MYD88 impacts DC functionality, contributing to variations in HCC \nprogression.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Liu, Zhu, Zhang, Huang, Zhu, He, Yao, Song and Zhang.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fcell.2025.1554705\nPMCID: PMC11973264\nPMID: 40196847\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.",

Mechanistically, \nestrogen and IGF1 facilitate FXR1 protein translation via the \nPI3K/AKT/mTOR/EIF4E pathway. FXR1 enhances cellular resistance to apoptosis and \nferroptosis by facilitating the maturation of BCL2 pre-mRNA and stabilizing GPX4 \nmRNA, respectively.

The \nrole of systemic inflammation markers in predicting pCR and the long-term \nprognosis of breast cancer patients undergoing NAC remains controversial. The \npurpose of this study was to explore the potential predictive and prognostic \nvalue of systemic inflammation markers (NLR, PLR, LMR, NMR) and \nclinicopathological characteristics in breast cancer patients receiving NAC and \nconstruct a pCR prediction model based on these indicators.\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 209 breast cancer patients \nwho received NAC at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital between January 2010 and March \n2020. Independent sample t-tests, chi-square tests, and logistic regression \nmodels were used to evaluate the correlation between clinicopathological data, \nsystemic inflammation markers, and pCR. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) \ncurves were utilized to determine the optimal cut-off values for NLR, PLR, and \nLMR. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank \ntest. A predictive model for pCR was constructed using machine learning \nalgorithms.\nRESULTS: Among the 209 breast cancer patients, 29 achieved pCR. During a median \nfollow-up of 68 months, 74 patients experienced local or distant metastasis, and \n56 patients died. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that lymph node \nstatus, HER-2 status, NLR, PLR, and LMR were associated with pCR. ROC curve \nanalysis revealed that the optimal cut-off values for NLR, PLR, and LMR were \n1.525, 113.620, and 6.225, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression \nanalysis indicated that lymph node status, NLR, and LMR were independent \npredictive factors for pCR. Survival analysis demonstrated that lymph node \nstatus, NLR, and LMR were associated with prognosis. Machine learning algorithm \nanalysis identified the random forest (RF) model as the optimal predictive model \nfor pCR.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that lymph node status, NLR, and LMR had \nsignificant value in predicting pCR and prognosis in breast cancer patients. The \nRF model provides a simple and cost-effective tool for pCR prediction, offering \nstrong support for clinical decision-making in breast cancer treatment and \naiding in the optimization of individualized treatment strategies.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Sun, Guan, Yu, Zhang, Tao, Zhang and Yao.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fonc.2025.1552802\nPMCID: PMC11973675\nPMID: 40196740\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.",

In this study, we \ndiscovered a 132 amino acid protein in human breast cancer cells named XCP ( X \n-linked C ancer-associated P olypeptide), which is encoded by lncRNA1456 (a.k.a. \nRHOXF1P3 ), a transcript previously thought to be noncoding. lncRNA1456 is a \npancreas- and testis-specific RNA whose gene is located on chromosome X. We \nfound that the expression of lncRNA1456 and XCP are highly upregulated in the \nluminal A, luminal B, and HER2 molecular subtypes of breast cancer. XCP \nmodulates both estrogen-dependent and estrogen-independent growth of breast \ncancer cells by regulating cancer pathways, as shown in cell and xenograft \nmodels. XCP shares some homology with homeodomain-containing proteins and \ninteracts with the histone demethylase plant homeodomain finger protein 8 \n(PHF8), which is also encoded by an X-linked gene. Mechanistically, XCP \nstimulates the histone demethylase activity of PHF8 to regulate gene expression \nin breast cancer cells. These findings identify XCP as a coregulator of \ntranscription and emphasize the need to interrogate the potential functional \nroles of open reading frames originating from noncoding RNAs.\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANGE: XCP, a polypeptide encoded by an X-linked lncRNA, \nregulates gene expression in breast cancer cells. XCP is a chromatin-associated \nprotein that interacts with the histone demethylase PHF8 and modulates its \ndemethylase activity to regulate gene expression. XCP drives cancer-specific \nphenotypes and serves as a potential biomarker and/or target for therapeutic \nintervention.\n\nDOI: 10.1101/2025.03.21.644649\nPMCID: PMC11974697\nPMID: 40196671",

However, there \nremains a paucity of information to guide management. The authors aimed to study \nimaging features associated with pathologic upgrade rates for patients with \nflorid lobular carcinoma in situ identified on core biopsy undergoing surgical \nexcision. Methods: Patients with florid lobular carcinoma in situ on core biopsy \nwere selected from an institutional pathology database. Patients were excluded \nif pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ was also present on core biopsy. \nClinical, radiologic, and pathologic features for each case were reviewed \nfocusing on imaging features which led to core biopsy and those associated with \npathologic upgrade on surgical excision. Results: Eighteen cases of florid \nlobular carcinoma in situ underwent surgical excision.

Of the 8 \ncases with upgrade to invasive lobular carcinoma, 7/8 (87.5%) were Stage I \ncancers and only 1/8 (12.5%) had macroscopic lymph node involvement and was \nupgraded to Stage II. Conclusion: Florid lobular carcinoma in situ on core \nbiopsy had an upgrade rate on surgical excision of 50% overall, with 89% of \nthese cases upgraded to invasive lobular carcinoma. Pathologic upgrade was seen \nmore frequently with suspicious calcifications and larger breast lesions.

In early-stage disease, \npembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has \nsignificantly improved pathologic complete response, event-free survival, and \noverall survival, establishing a new standard of care. Ongoing research aims to \ndetermine the optimal timing for ICI administration, explore less toxic \nchemotherapy backbones, utilize biomarkers for personalized treatment, and \nassess whether adding complementary treatments, such as radiation therapy for \nhigh-risk cases, can improve outcomes. This review examines the successes and \nsetbacks of ICI use in TNBC, offering a comprehensive overview of current \npractices and future directions. It emphasizes optimizing ICI timing, leveraging \nbiomarkers, and integrating novel agents to refine treatment approaches for both \nmetastatic and early-stage TNBC. As immunotherapy continues to evolve, future \nresearch must address the unmet needs of this challenging breast cancer subtype, \noffering hope for improved outcomes.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Corti et al.\n\nDOI: 10.2147/ITT.S495751\nPMCID: PMC11974553\nPMID: 40196378\n\nConflict of interest statement: CCo reports travel/accommodations (to scientific \nmeeting) from Veracyte (2023), and is supported by the Fondazione Gianni \nBonadonna (FGB) and Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca contro il Cancro (AIRC) \n(2024-2026).
